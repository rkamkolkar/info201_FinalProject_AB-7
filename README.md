### For our project, we looked at Airbnb data from New York City in 2019 to examine different trends across various variables in an effort to give useful insight to our target audience on how to improve business. We look at multiple areas, including how pricing affects Airbnb popularity, how the number of reviews a property gets impacts its price, how the number of reviews impacts bookings, and the relationship between blocking status and daily rates.

### Our target audience includes both Airbnb property managers (those who manage the property while guests are there) as well as Airbnb hosts (those who own the property itself), to give them insight on various metrics that affect their Airbnb business. With our analysis, we hope to highlight possible improvements both of these groups can make in order to make their Airbnb operations much more successful.
